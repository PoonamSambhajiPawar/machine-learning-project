#Customer Market Basket analysis

Introduction:
Machine learning is helping the retail industry in many ways. From forecasting the sales performance to identifying the prospective buyers, there are a lot of applications of machine learning in the retail industry. Market basket analysis is one of the key applications of machine learning in retail. By analysing the past buying behaviour of customers, one can find out which are the products that are bought together by the customers.
For example, bread and butter are sold together, baby diapers and baby massage oil are sold together, etc. That means one can analyze the association among products. If the retails management can find this association, while placing the products in the shop, these associated products can be put together. Or, when seeing that a customer is buying a product, the salesman can offer the associated product to the customer. 
This process of analyzing the association is called the Association Rule Learning and analyzing the products bought together by the customers is called the Market Basket Analysis. In this article, we will discuss the association rule learning method with a practical implementation of market basket analysis in python. We will use the Apriori algorithm as an association rule method for market basket analysis.

obectives:
1.	Market basket analysis is to identify products that customers want to purchase.
2.	Market basket analysis enables sales and marketing teams to develop more effective product placement, pricing, cross-sell, and up-sell strategies.
3.	Market Basket Analysis models is to identify the next product that might interest a customer.

Algorithms :
•	Apriori Algorithm –
Apriori algorithm is a machine learning model used in Association Rule Learning to identify frequent itemsets from a dataset. This model has been highly applied on transactions datasets by large retailers to determine items that customers frequently buy together with high probability.
•	Association rule –
Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. In transaction data, the AIS algorithm determines which large itemsets contained a transaction, and new candidate itemsets are created by extending the large itemsets with other items in the transaction data.
